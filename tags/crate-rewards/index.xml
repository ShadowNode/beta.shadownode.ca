Crates contain items, the quality of which depends on the tier of the crate. To open a create you must hold the crate key in your hand and right click the corresponding crate. You can obtain crate keys by either purchasing them from our shop, or buy buying them in our token shop. Note Some items on this list may not be on your server as some modpacks don&amp;rsquo;t have all the mods as others.</description></item></channel></rss>
