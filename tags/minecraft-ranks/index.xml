The first few include some commands with many being useful and some fun ones included with a few.
Also, every rank inherits the commands/features from the previous ranks. Price of each rank is also located on the shop page.
Note All ranks have access to their specific prefix in /perks. Meaning if you have example eclipse rank you may use the prefix Member/Shade/Night/Equinox/Eclipse (like hide your rank or use another).</description></item></channel></rss>
