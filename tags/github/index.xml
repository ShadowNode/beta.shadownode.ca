It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a character count and it&amp;rsquo;s just as easy to use as other tools. Using a copy and paste tool like Gist is recommended if you have issues with client crashes since it keeps the formatting of the log, and makes it easier to read the file without having to download it.</description></item></channel></rss>
