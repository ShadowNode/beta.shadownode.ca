-----------------------------

Servers restart every once in a while to reduce lag. This does not mean that a restart will fix all kinds of lag. So, 
please, **do not** ask staff to restart a server due to lag. **Restarts are NOT wipes**, they are just a scheduled reboot to the server. 

*Ground items are cleared every 20 minutes (XX:10, XX:30, XX:50). There is a 1 minute warning before a clear.*

{{% notice note %}}
All times listed are in Eastern Standard Time (EST). This is the same as GMT-5. Wipes will happen during the nightly 
restart. Restarts happen both in the AM and in the PM. The times might appear to be an hour off if you're currently in 
Daylight 
Savings Time (DST).

| Undergarden     | 28            | N/A         |
| Hunting Dim     | 28            | N/A         |

Compact Machines, Spectre, and the Void dimensions are not wiped. **The overworld and space are only wiped if there are heavy lag issues that the staff team cannot fix.**

{{% notice warning %}}
Any items lost from these  wipes will not get refunded as there are many warnings before the wipe occurs. Overworld wipes will remove everything, and the server will start over fresh.
