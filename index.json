To find out how see contributing.\n 1.16 vs 1.12 Packs Many of you are already familiar with 1.12.2 and 1.16 packs but there are some key changes that seemingly impact all 1.16 packs as a whole. As a result of this you’re likely wondering what’s changed and how you can work around it. The good news is that while some things are not able to be corrected around you can still access many of your “missing” perks by loading the lobby with a 1.12.2 client.\nKnown Issues Token Loaders Currently due to us using a different plugin for chunkloading on 1.16 there isn’t token loaders for these packs. While we hope to add these back in the future, you currently have to purchase loaders from the shop should you wish to use them.\nGlow/Particle Effects Currently this is only supported on 1.12.2 packs. We do hope to have an update for this in the future.\nCan’t Access Lobby The Lobby and events server will not support 1.16.5 modpacks. This is unfortunately something that we can’t fix due to the changes in Forge that send all FML packets right at login. This also prevents server switching and being kicked to the lobby.\nCant Change Join / Leave This is a known limitation. You can change your join / leave status by joining the Lobby with 1.12.2 client and running /status. For more details on this command please see the store page.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"1.16 Packs","uri":"/modpack-tips/1-16_packs/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"admin","uri":"/tags/admin/"},{"content":"Public Transit Within Claims Viaducts and Waystones are a great and fun way to get around an expansive base while not forcing the use of homes and teleportation requests to other friends and basemates! That being said, typically you would need to give them full access to inventories such as your chests, crates, ME systems, etc. You can solve this by issuing some commands that will set “flags”, these are extra settings that override the default behavior.\nThe question ultimately comes down to if you want to fully trust everyone that you want to have access to your Waystones, Viaducts, etc. or if you rather they have access exclusively to the Waystones, etc.\nHow to grant access to Waystones To fix this you simply need to run 4 commands within your claim(s) - This must be run in every single claim that you wish to use it within or they will not have permission to do so in other claims.\nThe following commands will need to be run one at a time and will allow you to have anyone who visits your claim to have access to use your Waystones, etc. but nothing else, they will not have access to build or access other items. As with other transportation items they will need to be run on all claims that you wish this to be enabled in.\n/cf interact-inventory waystones:waystone true - This allows interactions of inventory only when the inventory is a waystone. In this case it’s looking for the mod waystones and the material waystone.\n/cf interact-inventory-click waystones:waystone true - The same applies here, however, it’s applying to inventory clicking/usage.\n/cf interact-item-secondary waystones:waystone true - This allows the item to be right-clicked when it is of the proper type. This means it will bring the waystones’ UI up.\n/cf interact-block-secondary waystones:waystone true - Same as directly above, but will allow you to interact with waystones in the sense of it being a block.\nHow to grant access to Viaducts Viaducts are a bit different as well as they will require you to have the chunks loaded on both the entrance/exit. The commands will change from waystones:waystone to thermaldynamics:duct_64. This is changing the item/material’s ID to the correct one for Viaducts. You can find this out via some changes you can make within Walia or JEI.\nTo simply run the commands to enable it please issue the commands below.\n/cf interact-inventory thermaldynamics:duct_64 true\n/cf interact-inventory-click thermaldynamics:duct_64 true\n/cf interact-item-secondary thermaldynamics:duct_64 true\n/cf interact-block-secondary thermaldynamics:duct_64 true\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Advanced Claim Management","uri":"/home/guides/advancedclaims/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"area","uri":"/tags/area/"},{"content":"About ATLauncher How to Install  Head to ATLauncher and select which software is most appropriate for you.

Choose your install directory and click next.  Make sure “Install Java” is checked. Click next and then on the next screen click next again. Finally click Install.  Disable Analytics by unchecking the box and click Save   Adding a Modpack Now that ATLauncher is installed you likely want to install a modpack to get playing on our modded network. To get started simply follow the directions below.\n Click Packs and then type the name of the pack you want to install in the top search bar. I’ll be using “SkyFactory 4”.  On the search result page click “New Instance” and then you’ll be prompted by a popup. In this window select the version you wish to install.  Once the install completes you’ll be able to play by clicking “Instances” on the right hand bar then clicking Play for the pack in question.  Setting Java Arguments Some packs have Java Arguments (args) that we recommend you the pack with. The other reasons you might want to change this is you have a set of arguments that you want to run or someone suggested a set of Java arguments. The below assumes you’re setting it per instance.\n Go to your “Instance Tab” and click the “Settings” button to open a pack configuration window.  Click “Java/Minecraft” and paste the arguments you wish to use in the “Java Parameters” that you wish to use. We’ve highlighted the box in red.  Once you’ve happy with your changes, click “Save” and you’ll be good to go. Please note that if you make a mistake and your pack won’t launch you can always click the “Reset” button.

There are two types of Chunk Loaders, Always On and Online Only. To view chunk borders, hit F3+g\nAlways On vs Online Only Always On is a chunk loader which is online 24/7 and will keep the chunk loaded. However, the chunk loader will stop loading the chunk after 48 (1.16 packs) or 72 (1.12 packs) hours of activity. Once the owner returns, it will resume loading the chunk.The Online Only chunk loader will only load the chunk when the owner of the loader is online.\nToken-earned Loaders vs Shop bought Loaders Token Loaders are always online-only and cannot be transfered between servers. They are also reset when the server is reset so you will need to earn them again through voting. Also, please keep in mind that token loaders are currently not working on 1.16 packs, however, are still avaliable on 1.12 packs.\nShop Loaders are avalaible in Online Only as well as Always On. You can get Shop loaders transfered between servers and reinstated after a server reset.\nYou will need to open a ticket in our Discord server to accomplish this.\nNoteShop bought loaders being moved must already be deactivated to be moved to a new server. Please note that on 1.16 packs the loader block must also have been removed.\n 1.16 Chunkloaders Checking your Balance To check the number of chunks you have and may use on 1.16 servers you can run the following command to see your current chunkloaders /ificlt balance\nCreating Chunkloaders To create a chunkloader in 1.16 servers you will now need a physical block to do so as well as a blaze rod. The block that you need depends on the type of loader you have. The following blocks are used for the following type of loaders by default:\n Always Online - Diamond Block Online Only - Gold Block  NotePlease note that these blocks can change per pack. You can also view the current blocks for your pack by typing /ificlt info.\n Once you place the correct block in the chunk you wish to load (or radius load) you need to right click it with a Blaze Rod. If you have enough free chunk loaders you can create a radius chunk loader by right clicking the chunk loader block again. Please note that you can only assign a radius up to the maximum amount of chunk loaders you have and not larger than a radius of 4 per chunk loader. Once you are happy with your chunk loader set up shift-right click it to activate the loader. You can shift-right click one of your own loaders to disable it as well. WarningIf you need to break a chunk loader to move it or want the resources back you need to first shift-right click the chunk loader block with a blaze rod. Doing so will show that you have disabled the loader and it’s been returned to your balance. Doing so will also delete the chunk loader so you will no longer have it loaded!.\n Showing Loaded Chunks You can see the loaded chunks by right clicking on the loader with a peice of glow stone dust. This will create an effect that looks like a world border going out from the loader block and creating a square box of loaded chunks going out. This is super helpful with knowing what all you have loaded on radius loaders.\n1.10 And 1.12 Chunkloaders The most basic command in the plugin is /betterchunkloader, or just /bcl for short. Executing this command will open an interface in the chat that the user may interact with. The interface will contain a list of active chunk loaders you currently own, along with some user-friendly icons. An example of the interface is below. Checking Your Balance To check the number of chunks you may use/have used, you can click the Balance or run /bcl bal. The interface will state the number of both Always Online and Online Only chunks that are currently active (used) and are available. How to Create Chunk Loaders From the main interface, you should click the Create icon or run /bcl create to begin the process of creating a Chunk Loader. An interface will open and should look like the following image. The interface will state the name of the chunk loader Owner. It will also give you the coordinates of the chunk that you are currently standing in. Please note that these coordinates are different than regular XYZ coordinates. To create an Always Online chunk loader or Online Only chunk loader, click their respective icons. You should be prompted with the following interface. The Radius icons will determine the size of the chunk loader. You can only load as many chunks as your balance allows. Hovering over the icon will display how many chunks will be loaded with each radius upgrade. After you select your radius size, your chunk loader will be created. You will be shown a confirmation window which will display your name, loader id, and state. If you’d like to delete your loader and regain your chunk balance, click the Delete icon. How to View Active Chunk Loaders Once you have Chunk Loaders active, running /bcl will contain some information regarding regarding your active chunk loaders. You can hover over the Chunk icon to view the coordinates of the chunk loader. Clicking View will pull up the same prompt that was displayed after you created your loader originally. How to Read Chunk Coordinates To view the coordinates of the chunk you are currently in, press F3. You will see the typical statistics of your game, which should resemble the image below. The value in the red box is your chunk coordinates.

Every block claimed is accounted for. You can buy claim blocks from the tokenshop, or from the store. Before claiming any land, please make sure to check which method of claiming you currently are using, 2D or 3D. Once your method of choice is confirmed, we can begin claiming. If you are in 2D mode, right click two opposite corners of the intended claim. For 3D mode, right click two opposite corners, one at the lowest point in the claim, and the other at the highest point in the claim. You can right click the air or ground with a stick to see who claims the block you are looking at.\n2D vs 3D 2D means that no what Y level you claim the blocks on, Grief Prevention will make your claim from bedrock to make build level. 3D will require you to claim your area in a cube and will only claim what is inside the cube.\nHow to Subdivide Claims Subdividing your claim means making smaller sections in the bigger claim to allow people to build/access certain parts of your base. To subdivide claims, hold your golden shovel and run the command subdivideclaims. This changes your golden shovel to create smaller claims. This is always in 2D mode, but it reaches to the highest level of your main claim. When you select two corners you see iron blocks instead of golden blocks. To get out of subdivideclaims mode, scroll your mouse wheel off the golden shovel and then back onto it. This can be used to make towns and/or sell plots to other players for in-game currency.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Claiming","uri":"/home/guides/claiming/"},{"content":"Intro You might want to contribute code, content or time to this wiki and are unsure how to do so.

It’s recommended to accept the migration.\n Adding a Modpack When you launch into FTB App you will be greeted with a simple interface that will show you featured Modpacks. This interface will likely look somewhat familiar if you’ve used the CurseForge beta launcher as they are similiar.\nThere’s a few options to install modpacks with the simplest being to search directly for the pack.\n Click the search icon on the left hand side of the window.  This will take you to a new window that looks like the following. Please type the name of the modpack you’re looking to install in the search bar at the top. We’ll use OceanBlock in this example.

You should be finally looking at the screen that looks l ike this. You can click play to launch your pack.   Updating Modpacks Time to time pack authors will release updates to packs and prompt us to update our servers as a result. When this happens you will also need to update your pack version to be able to connect. Luckily with FTB App this is simple to do.\n Make sure you’re on this page and then click “Versions”  Click on the version you would like to install, for example 1.3.0 then click the orange update button.  The modpack will now be preforming an update that looks / behaves very much like an install would normally. Once this process is done you’ll have a green “View Instance” button to click and then you’re able to play the updated pack.  Backup Modpacks with FTB App At the time of writing there’s currently no way to backup modpacks on this launcher through the app.\nSetting Java Arguments Some packs have Java Arguments (args) that we recommend you the pack with. The other reasons you might want to change this is you have a set of arguments that you want to run or someone suggested a set of Java arguments.\n Go to your library and then click on the modpack you’d like to edit the arguments for.

Staff response will depend on the situation.\nGetting Started If you’ve never played on ShadowNode’s OceanBlock server, the way you get started is to run /is create. Make sure you read the rules in spawn first.\nKnown Issues  NoteThis list is current as of the time of writing this but might not always be up-to-date. Take advice here with that knoweldge.\n Below is a current list of known issues with Ocean Block and work arounds (if any)\nJoining an Island Wipes Inventory and Progress Currently if you join a team or island after you’re already started the game you will lose all of your currently unlocked quest progress as well as having everything in your inventory wiped.\nWhile we cannot prevent the loss of quest progress when joining a team or creating an island we can help you keep your items. To do so simply have your friend trust you manually on the island. To do so they will need to type /trust your_playername and then allow you to place your stuff on their island. Once you have fully moved your items off your island and player’s inventory you should be safe to join their team without losing items.\nPleae note that ShadowNode staff will not refund any items to a player who’s inventory gets wiped by joining another team / island.\nServer Reboot Crashes Client The most common client crash is upon a server reboot if you don’t log out ahead of time. This crash is typically caused by a mod called MineTogether. You can easily remove the mod if you’re using MultiMC you can do so with the following steps.\nWarningBefore attempting the steps below make sure that you have a backup of your instance! Failure to do so may result in you having to redownload your pack again.\n MultiMC Please follow the steps below when the game is not running.\n Right Click on the instance and select Edit Instance from the menu that pops up. On the left hand of the window you will see a list of icons and options. Click Loader Mods. At the bottom of this new section there’s a text box that is labeled filter type in MineTogether. You should then see only one mod listed. Uncheck the check box for this mod and click Close. You should now be able to launch your pack without MineTogether and not have it crash on server reboot.  Manual (FTB App, GD Launcher) Please follow these diretions for any launcher other than MultiMC please follow the following steps. While doing these steps ensure the game is not currently running.\n Right click on the instance icon and select the option to open the instances folder. This can vary by app and version and is currently listed as “Open Folder” on GD Launcher. Open in the new file browser window go to the following path mods, scroll down till you see a file named like the following minetogether-1.16.5-x.x.x-forge.jar and rename it to minetogether-1.16.5-x.x.x-forge.jar.disabled. If you don’t have file extensions enabled in Windows Explorer I highly recommend simply pressing CTRL+X and then going up to the instance folder and pasting the mod there with CTRL+V.

Take advice here with that knoweldge.\n Important Rules Our Stoneblock 2 server has some additional rules on the server apart from the global rules you find on all our servers.\n Max 2 Imaginary Time Blocks. This applies per team/base/area. Max 2 Growth Crystals. This applies per team/base/area. Cows and Chickens  Cows and Chickens must always be in their respective pens. If they are not in one for a set time limit they will despawn.  Chickens - 5 minutes Cows - 30 minutes   You can have a max of 4 of each chicken/cow. This is a stack of 4 per roost. Large amounts of roosts will be removed. You NEED a vacuum hopper or item collector setup for chickens. And a tank setup for cows.  If the pens get full they likely will spit out items / fluids and this will result in the removal of all chickens/cows from your area.     Do not build 1 chunk bases or farms. Action will be taken by staff as necessary.  Commands There’s a good number of commands that you should be aware of for using this pack, especially in group play and you can find them on our commands page under the Island/Cave section.\nGetting Started WarningCreating or resetting an area will wipe your inventory and progress\n If you’ve never played on ShadowNode’s Stoneblock 2 server, the way you get started is to run /area create. Make sure you read the rules in spawn first.\nCommon Issues Extra Utils not working This typically happens when you don’t have enough Grid Power (GP). When this happens it may appear that you have enough, however, if you’re sharing a base with someone or someone else placed the block will have the GP earned / stored based off of them. To solve this you will need to share your GP with your base mates(s). To do so you will need to use /xu_powershare. For more details please see our Commands page and look under Miscellaneous Commands.\nSuggested Changes Disable Craft Presence GUI Craft Presence is a mod that is designed to allow you to share your currently playing status to Discord, however, it has keybinds and other features that disrupt use of other core features. One core feature it has a conflicting keybind with is the veinminer mod.\nNormally we would suggest rebinding the key for Craft Presence’s GUI in the controls setting, however, they have moved it. To disable the keybinding you can follow the steps below to regain access to Ultiminer.\n Press the grave key - `. You will get a new GUI window with options pop up when you do so.  Click the button labeled “Accessibility Settings” and you should see the following page.  At the bottom there’s a button labled “Config GUI Keybind” that you need to click. Once you do it will say “None” so you’ll simply need to press “ESC” on your keyboard to delete the keybind. Press the back key. You will now be redirected back to the original screen and there will now be a new button in the middle at the bottom that says “Save”. Click this and you’re able to use FTB Ultimine normally.

It can be used to launch vanilla Minecraft, custom modpacks, or regular modpacks. This launcher is one of our recommended options for installing modpacks and managing mods. GDLauncher works on all major platforms - Windows, Linux and macOS.\nHow to Install  Head to GDevs and select which software is most appropriate for you. Typically you want to click the “Download Now!” button. Click the download link related to your OS and then save it to your Downloads folder for easy access. Click the downloaded installer link and it will prompt you to install Java 8 and Java 16. This should be done automatically by the launcher with no intervention needed on your part. Next it should ask you to login to your Minecraft or Microsoft account. Please do so now. After this process is done you should be greeted by a mostly blank window telling you no instance has been installed. See below for more details on adding mod packs.  Adding a Modpack  Click the + button in GDLaunchers Main Window.  Click the type of instance you like. If you’re looking to install general Minecraft you’re looking for Vanilla otherwise you’re likely looking for CurseForge or FTB. If you’re using a FTB Pack please click the FTB Tab.  Click the search box and type in the name of the pack that you’re looking for. In the example below I’ve used OceanBlock.  Hover over the modpacks name and you will see an option to download latest or Explore / Versions. Click the Explore / Versions Option.  Now you will need to select your version of the modpack to begin the install. After this is done click Download.  Give your modpack download / instance a name. Click the next arrow.  Your modpack will now download. If you have issues with downloading Forge you might need to switch to the beta channel. Click “Play” after hovering over the modpacks name and it will launch the pack. Enjoy!   Managing Mods with GDLauncher WarningRemoving and adding mods can cause pack instablity. Please consult your launcher’s documentation on backing up your instance prior to preforming any of the tips below.\n Using GDLauncher is almost as easy as MultiMC but this will likely get even easier in the future. The current hardships is that you have to enable the beta channel for GDLauncher to get it work correctly at this time. Please follow the steps below if you’d like to manage your mods with GDLauncher.\n Right Click on the modpack and select Manage.  Click Mods  In the top right of the current window you’ll see a search box. Type in the first part of the name of the mod you wish to remove. For example FTB Auxilium you would type in FTB.  Click the toggle for the mod you’d like to disable. It should look like the below once you’ve completed this.  Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for any mods you’d like to disable. Click the X at the top of the window titled Instance Manager Launch your modpack to play.  Upgrading Modpacks WarningPlease backup your modpacks before upgrading incase something goes wrong. If your upgradse fails please create a new instance of the modpack.\n  CLick on your modpad and select “Manage”  In the Instance Manager window click “Mod Pack”  Click the drop down menu in the middle of the window to select the version you’re looking to upgrade to. Click switch version after you confirm you’ve selected the right version.   Backup Modpacks with GDLauncher If you’re wanting to modify the mods in your pack it’s highly recommend you backup your instance first. This prevents you from having to do a completely clean reinstall.\n Right click on your modpack and select “Duplicate”  Enter a name for the duplicated modpack and press the duplicate button.   Setting Java Arguments Some packs have Java Arguments (args) that we recommend you the pack with. The other reasons you might want to change this is you have a set of arguments that you want to run or someone suggested a set of Java arguments. The below assumes you’re setting it per instance.\n Right Click on your instance and select “Manage”  On the “Overview” tab, click the toggle next to “Override Java Arguments” it should look like the below when done.  Paste in your Java arguments into the text box that appeared. Click the “X” on the window to save. Launch your modpack. If any mistakes have happened you can go back to the previous window and click the reset button.  Enabling the Beta Launcher Sometimes Forge installations will fail when trying to download modpacks with GDLauncher. Luckily there’s a way around this. You will need to enable the beta release of the launcher for this. To do so simply follow the steps below.\n Click the settings icon at the top of the screen.  Change Release Channel to “Beta”. Click the “X” button at the top when done.  You will now need to restart your GDLauncher and relaunch it. Once you’ve done so give it a few and you should be prompted to update to the newest release. Update to the newer release and retry your pack install clean.

Infact, there’s often a few bundled mods in packs that simply add bloat, don’t provide any functionality to the end user and in the end are simply unnecessary to play the pack.\nPlease note that we only recommend making changes using advanced launchers such as MultiMC or GDLauncher.\nSuggested Changes FTB Auxilium All new FTB Packs seem to have this mod and we highly recommend you remove it because it sends computer and usage stats back to the FTB Team.\nReAuth Currently Minecraft is looking to migrate accounts from Mojang logins to Microsoft Accounts. This means that if you migrate your account this plugin will no longer work. Luckily there’s a new mod now called OAuth that you can use to retain the functionality of ReAuth if you choose to migrate early.

Typically a single Agricarft spinkler can be used to multiply the speed, however, the effect does stack. This can pose a problem as all the particles from this causes a considerable amount of client-side render time/lag.

On the left hand of the window you will see a list of icons and options. Click Loader Mods.  At the bottom of this new section there’s a text box that is labeled filter type in the first part of name of the mod you wish to disable. For example to disable FTB Auxiium you would type in FTB. You should then see only one mod listed. Uncheck the check box for this mod.  Repeat for any other mods you neeed to remove. Click “Close” when done. Launch your modpack to play.  Backing up your modpacks If you’re wanting to modify the mods in your pack it’s highly recommend you backup your instance first. This prevents you from having to do a completely clean reinstall.\n Select your modpack and right click it. Select copy instance.  Type a new name for the copied modpack in and click ok. Optionally you can also copy your saves and keep your play time. This is great if you want to try out a mod or two that you have a feeling will break your pack.  You will now have a duplicate modpack ready for backup purposes.

Aiming to provide players with the best experience possible, ShadowNode is proud to host over 15 diverse servers!\nRules These rules apply to our Discord, servers and all other services. By using our services, you are agreeing to follow these rules. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse. Staff are provided with a general guideline of punishments for each rule, however choose a punishment is at their discretion.\nRespect Staff and Staff Decisions  Do not in any way mock, abuse, argue with, or be disrespectful in general to any member of our staff. If you feel you have been mistreated by a staff member or believe a punishment you received is unjust, do not mock them or make a scene. Contact another member of the staff team to discuss the issue privately.  No Harassment, Flaming or Trolling  This includes repeated requests for something over DMs, frequent unwanted TPA requests, bullying someone in server chat or DMs, and any other kind of unwanted contact or abuse. We understand that friends may joke around with each other, but if a staff member asks you to stop, you should listen. Any joking around that includes cussing, vulgar sexual comments or hate speech will be punished as such.  No Foul Language, Hate Speech, Sexual Comments,Political/Religious Discussions, Drug Use Discussions  We want to provide a safe, positive and clean environment for everyone, so we have this rule to achieve that goal. Private conversations via whispers of this nature are allowed, provided one person is not harassing the other. Discussing ANY topic which talks about abusing drugs, whether they’re legal drugs or illegal drugs, is not allowed.  No Advertising, Spamming or Attention-Seeking  This includes advertising other servers or Discords, spamming random stuff in chat, or just general spamming to get attention for something, such as trying to sell something. Bear in mind, that asking for the same thing every few minutes DOES count as spamming.  No Excessive Mobs/Items Inside Mob Spawners  Spawners MUST auto-kill mobs as soon as they spawn. You are NOT allowed to have a spawner which requires a player to kill the mobs inside. Spawners must NOT clog with mobs or items. It is your responsibility to ensure that this doesn’t happen.  No Cheating, Hacking, Glitching, Duping  This includes using third-party programs, plugins and/or bugs to gain an unfair advantage in gameplay over other players. X-Ray bugs/resource packs are not allowed. Optifine, BetterFPS and similar framerate-boosting mods ARE allowed, but may cause technical issues with your Minecraft client.  No Begging From Staff Members Our staff members have access to Creative mode to deal with technical issues and discover bugs, not to give you free stuff. See the Refunds policy if you’ve lost something due to a glitch/bug\nNo Alt Accounts, Using Another User’s Account  Alt accounts, by definition, are other accounts that a player has access to. Alt accounts are often used to circumvent punishments that the staff have placed upon a different account. If you allow someone to use your account, and the account is banned, we will not lift the ban. You are responsible for your own account and anyone you let onto the account.  Don’t Minimod - Let Staff Do Their Jobs  Mini-modding is telling people what the rules are and what they should do without first consulting staff to see if it is okay to tell those people. You may only teach other users about the rules if a staff member has explicitly given you permission to do so. If a user is asking about rules and no staff member is around to assist them, you may link them to this page.  Do Not Evade Our AFK Timer, Modifications or Limitations   Evading the AFK Timer includes, but is not limited to:\n Any item, machine, third-party program, or building which would cause the AFK detection system to not kick you while you are away from your computer.    Evading Modifications/Limitations includes, but is not limited to:\n Breaking blocks in areas you are not supposed to be able to modify, bypassing the profanity filter, and the use of banned items.    If you are a designated tester for the server, then this is allowed only while staff are present and watching\n  No Refunds of Items Lost, Unless the Loss of Items was Caused by a Proven Glitch with Our Services  We do not refund items lost to graves failing to spawn, clicking the Baubles menu with an item by accident, accidentally throwing an item in a Trash Can, or any similar issue. These are mod bugs and user error, neither of which we are responsible for. We do not refund items lost in unclaimed bases being raided or griefed. You are responsible for securing your own base. WE will use Prism to roll back/undo the damage, but that is all we will do. We do not refund easy-to-replace items such as sand, wood, dirt, Oak Fence, etc. Staff will decide on a case-by-case basis if an item should be refunded.  Do Not Auto-mine in the Overworld  We have mining worlds for a reason, so the terrain of the overworld doesn’t get scarred by constant mining with Quarries or other mass-mining devices. If a quarry or quarry-like device is found in the overworld, it will be broken by a staff member. You may use a Quarry and/or similar devices for clearing space during base-building. 2x2 chunks maximum, with a 20 Y-level maximum.  Use English Only in the Main Chat  This is purely to help the staff troubleshoot things and keep the chat clear of confusing messages. Talking in other langues via private messages is allowed.  No Griefing  Griefing means to negatively change a building or area which you do not own or have permission to use. This includes, but is not limited to the following:  Breaking blocks from other’s builds, stealing items or resources from others. This also applies to buildings and areas where the area is player owner, but it is not evident who exactly owned it.    No raiding or Stealing, Even if the Base is Unclaimed  Includes all resource types.  Mana, power and livestock are also considered resources.    Do Not Use Discord to Evade Punishments  If a staff member mutes/bans you, it’s for a reason. Don’t use our Discord services to bypass our punishment. Create a support ticket to appeal/discuss it.  Do Not Impersonate a Staff Member  Impersonation means pretending to be someone else. This includes changing your nickname to a staff member’s username/nickname or adding Staff/Admin/Etc to any part of your nickname or rank. This also applies to custom join/leave messages.   Store Policies These policies apply for all purchases to ShadowNode and services or goods provided by ShadowNode. Punishments may include forfeiting of product or perks without refund permanently or for a given time.\nAll Transactions are Final  This means that you will not get any refunds for purchases, regardless of the circumstances, as you should’ve read what you wil be getting in depth in the first place.  No Abuse of a Product or its Perks  If you abuse any store items/ranks/privileges you will be subject to punishment without refund.  No Chargebacks  Chargebacks are when a customer reverses a transaction which has already been processed, usually done when goods are defective and therefore return the goods with a refund. As we do not do refunds here due to the digital nature of the services we provide, any chargebacks aimed at our services will be treated as an effort to defraud us.  No Purchases from Unconfirmed or Unauthorized Accounts  Purchases from unconfirmed accounts are not allowed. If a purchase was made from an account you are not authorized to use, the owner may contact us by email at payments@shadownode.ca to discuss refund. Once an account holder has contacted us and has been verified as the legitimate owner, we will terminate the account associated with the payment and they will be unable to access our services permanently.
